   * **New Wallet:** Follow the prompts to create a new wallet.
   * **Existing Wallet:** Import your existing wallet using your seed phrase.
3. **Configure Binance Smart Chain:**

#### Step 2: Fund Your Wallet with BNB

BNB is the native currency for Binance Smart Chain and is required to purchase FYH tokens. You can acquire BNB through:

* **Centralized Exchanges:** Purchase BNB directly from platforms like [Binance](https://www.binance.com/).
* **Swapping:** Exchange other cryptocurrencies for BNB on decentralized exchanges (DEX) like PancakeSwap.

Ensure that your wallet has sufficient BNB to cover both the token purchase amount and the associated gas fees.

#### Step 3: Connect Your Wallet to the FYH Token Sale DApp

1. **Access the DApp:**
   * Visit the **Buy FYH** section on our official website or go directly to the FYH Token Sale DApp.
2. **Connect Wallet:**
   * Click on the **Connect MetaMask** button.
   * Authorize the connection through your MetaMask or Trust Wallet interface.

#### Step 4: Purchase FYH Tokens

1. **Enter BNB Amount:**
   * Specify the amount of BNB you wish to spend. The corresponding FYH token amount will be calculated automatically based on the current rate.
2. **Review Details:**
   * Verify the transaction details, including the FYH amount and the BNB required.
3. **Confirm Transaction:**
   * Click **Proceed to Purchase**.
   * MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction. Review the gas fee and approve the transaction.
4. **Receive FYH Tokens:**
   * Upon successful transaction, FYH tokens will be sent directly to your connected wallet.

#### Troubleshooting

**Issue:** _"Gas Estimation Error"_

**Solution:** If you encounter a "Gas Estimation Error" while completing the transaction, manually set the gas limit to **300,000** or more. This ensures smooth transaction processing by providing sufficient gas for the smart contract execution.

### Liquidity Pool and Earning on PancakeSwap

After purchasing FYH tokens, you can maximize your earnings by participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities through providing liquidity on PancakeSwap.

#### Step 1: Add Liquidity to PancakeSwap
