# Supprise Airdrop

We believe in giving away free tokens to the community without having to announce it, it will come as a supprise and the team will decide "how much" and "when". It can be once a day, it can be once a week or once a month.

Nonetheless, it will not be the same address. Each wallet address that previously received a suprise airdrop, will be blocked from our Suprise Airdrop list.
