# Token Burn

“Burning” crypto means **permanently removing a number of tokens from circulation**. This is typically done by transferring the tokens in question to a burn address, i.e. a wallet from which they cannot ever be retrieved. This is often described as destroying tokens. A project burns its tokens to reduce the overall supply.

We will conduct Token burn from time to time, it will not be everyday, but definitely we will burn it. We may put to vote with the community to decide the "when" and the "amount". This will give the community to decide collectively the burning exercise of Fuyoh Token.

Once we have burn it, the proof of burn will be published. All burning will be send to this address: [0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD](https://bscscan.com/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)&#x20;
